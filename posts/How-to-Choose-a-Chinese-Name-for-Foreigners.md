Here’s how to pick the perfect Chinese name:
1. **Sound Similarity**: Find a name that resembles your original name. For example, "Mark" could become "Ma Ke" (马克).
2. **Meaningful Characters**: Select characters with positive meanings that match your personality or interests. For instance, "Hao Ran" (浩然) means "great and righteous."
3. **Simplicity**: Avoid overly complicated characters—stick to commonly used ones so everyone can call you easily.

Remember, your Chinese name should feel authentic yet personal. Don’t hesitate to experiment until you find the right fit!
