Throughout history, many notable figures have had names rich in cultural significance. Take **Confucius (孔子, Kǒng Zǐ)**, whose surname "孔" means "hole" or "opening," symbolizing wisdom and openness. His courtesy name, "仲尼" (Zhòng Ní), reflects his role as a respected teacher.

Another example is **Sun Yat-sen (孙中山, Sūn Zhōngshān)**, one of China's most revered leaders. His name combines "孙" (his family name) with "中山," referring to Mount Zhong, a place of great importance in Chinese mythology. The name suggests strength, stability, and leadership.

Interestingly, some historical figures changed their names during pivotal moments in their lives. For instance, **Emperor Kangxi (康熙, Kāngxī)** adopted his era name to signify peace and prosperity during his reign.

These stories highlight how names not only reflect individual identities but also capture the spirit of an era.
