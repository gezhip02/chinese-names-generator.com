In many Chinese families, names act like a family tree connecting different generations. One way to do this is through "generation names"—a shared character chosen from a family genealogy chart.

For example, all cousins in one generation might use "De" (德), meaning "virtue," while the next generation uses "Jia" (嘉), meaning "excellent." This helps preserve family unity and history across generations.

Even if you're not from a traditional Chinese family, adopting a similar approach can make your Chinese name feel more connected to your roots.
