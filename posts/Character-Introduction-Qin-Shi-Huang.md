秦始皇: qín shǐ huáng

Qin Shi Huang, born Ying Zheng, became the first emperor of a unified China in 221 BCE. Known for his ambitious reforms, he centralized authority, abolished feudalism, and implemented standardized systems for weights, measures, currency, and writing.

Although criticized for his harsh methods, such as burning books and burying scholars alive, Qin Shi Huang's achievements laid the foundation for future dynasties.

His construction of the Great Wall and the Terracotta Army remains iconic symbols of ancient Chinese civilization. Despite controversies surrounding his reign, Qin Shi Huang's legacy endures as a pivotal figure in Chinese history.
