李白: lǐ bái

Li Bai was one of the greatest poets during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). He lived from 701 to 762 AD and is celebrated for his imaginative and romantic style, earning him the nickname "Poet Immortal".

His works frequently celebrate nature, friendship, wine, and personal freedom. Traveling widely across China, Li Bai left behind more than 900 poems that vividly depict natural beauty, emotional depth, and philosophical reflections on life's impermanence.

Unlike Du Fu, another leading poet of the era, Li Bai focused on individuality, spontaneity, and mystical Daoist themes. His verses are admired for their simplicity yet profound meaning, making them accessible to contemporary readers worldwide.
