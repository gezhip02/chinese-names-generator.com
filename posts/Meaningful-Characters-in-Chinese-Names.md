When choosing a name, Chinese parents carefully select characters with positive meanings. For example:
- "Ming" (明) means "bright," like a shining star.
- "An" (安) means "peace," like a calm harbor.
- "Xin" (欣) means "joy," like a big smile.

Historically, there was a tradition called "avoidance taboo," where people avoided using characters similar to those of emperors or elders to show respect. While this isn't strictly followed today, many still steer clear of names resembling family members'.

If you're picking a Chinese name, aim for something simple yet meaningful—something that matches your personality without being too hard to pronounce!
