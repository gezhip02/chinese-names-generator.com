In Chinese culture, numbers hold significant meaning and are often incorporated into names to bring good fortune. For example, the number **6 (liù)** is associated with smoothness and success, while **8 (bā)** symbolizes wealth and prosperity because it sounds similar to the word "发" (fā), which means "to become wealthy." Conversely, the number **4 (sì)** is avoided as it sounds like "死" (sǐ), meaning death.

Parents sometimes choose names that incorporate these lucky numbers or their homophones. For instance, a name might include characters that sound like "六" or "八" to wish the child a prosperous life. On the flip side, they avoid using characters that resemble unlucky numbers.

Fun Fact: Some businesses even pay premium prices for phone numbers or addresses containing multiple eights, believing it will bring them good luck!
