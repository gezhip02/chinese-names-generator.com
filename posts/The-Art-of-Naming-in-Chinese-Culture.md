Naming a baby was once a sacred ritual in Chinese culture. Traditionally, fathers gave names three months after birth, though some babies were named earlierâ€”during full moon celebrations or even before birth!

Today, naming practices have evolved. Parents often choose names inspired by what they love, hope for their child, or current events. For instance, during national milestones, you might see names like "Guoqing" (meaning "National Day") or "Jianjun" (meaning "Army Building").

This blend of tradition and modernity makes every Chinese name unique and meaningful.
