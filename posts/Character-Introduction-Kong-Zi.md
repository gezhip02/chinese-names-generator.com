孔子: kǒng zǐ

Kong Zi, or Confucius, was a philosopher and educator who lived from 551 to 479 BCE. Founder of Confucianism, his teachings emphasized morality, family loyalty, respect for elders, and justice.

These principles profoundly influenced Chinese society and government for centuries. Through works like *The Analects*, Kong Zi advocated for benevolent leadership and personal virtue.

Today, Confucian ideals remain integral to East Asian cultures and continue to resonate globally as valuable lessons in ethics and governance.
